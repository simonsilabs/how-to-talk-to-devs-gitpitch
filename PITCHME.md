# How to talk to developers

Note:
You have a meeting (or many meetings) with them to talk through how a new product or feature will work. But afterwards, you somehow end up on different pages, and the development process ends up being far more difficult than it should.

- what a designer sees |
- what a developer sees |

![some screen]()
- design tasks |
- developer tasks |

Note:
And that's okay!

## Context is different

+++

### Context for a Designer:
- user needs |
- should look nice |
- define how it should work |
- ... |

Note:
Designers are much closer to users, in direct contact

+++

### Context for a Developer:
- define how it actually works |
- should be clean & DRY |
- ... |

Note:
Many developers don't have level of "intuitive" awareness of how things should work
DRY = Dont repeat yourself -> because it creates unneccesary work

+++

### Developer needs:

They won't tell you until you ask them

Note:
But often they won't tell you their needs until you ask them.

+++

### You define the tasks

+++

### Communicate clearly and in a way that will make the dev's life easy

Note:
You define and give tasks to devs -> It's your duty to communicate it in a way thats clear to devs.
If lucky a dev will think through it, but you can not expext that.

---

## You have a lot in common

- you just don't know yet |

+++

### Machines are good in

- repetitive tasks
- being precise

Note:
So naturally, the same applies to devs

+++

### Machines are not good
- "intuitive" things

Note:



---

### --> Think in Systems!

Note:
you as designer want consistency. that's why you should start thinking in classes (like developers). Create a collection of classes used in your project and hand them to developers. e.g. all text styles


---



## Checklist

+++

### 1. ask: how could we save an hour?

Note:
when showing a screen do developer, ask them: "How could we save an hour by with a small change" e.g. by using standard input fields

+++

### 2. Identify re-usable components

try to look at things in a system, not just in their context
and reduce to what is really needed.

also define "invisible" values like margin


Note:
bsp snook
whenever you copy&paste something in the design file (or use symbols/shared styles), it probably makes sense to create a re-usable module

+++

### 3. define states

like active, hover, disbaled..

+++

### 4. name things together

based on a naming convention
be consistent and stick to it!

+++

### don't handover pixel-perfect screens

everybody should know that the system beats your sketchfile

+++


You're not talking in the same language

---

##  Other notes:

+++

### Project Planning is key
- no last-minute changes |
- 


---

Theres only one way to *really* understand a developer:
become one ;)
